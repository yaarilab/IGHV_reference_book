# Datasets and processing {.unnumbered}
The book includes these datasets taken from [VDJbase.org](vdjbase.org):

```{r table2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
|dataset | Type | Sequence Length|
|:------:|:----:|:---------------:|
|P1      | Naive| Full length    |
|P11     | Naive| Full length    |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```

The repertoires have been processed as following:

* Functional sequence, no stop codons or frame shifts.
* Sequences which start from position 1 of the V gene for full length sequences.
* Sequences which didn't include any gaps (-) or any N's in the V region.
* After changing into ASC annotations, sequences which had more than a single assignment in naive repertoires were remove.
