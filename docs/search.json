    "text": "How to read this book?\nEach chapter of this book showcases a different IGHV functional group. The chapters include information on the expression of the alleles assigned to these groups in several projects. Our allele-based genotype method has set allele thresholds and options to interactively “play” with the data, to gain insights into the group’s expressed alleles and the genotype combinations.\nWe included the functional groups for full and partial (BIOMED-2) length V segments. The groups’ numbers differ between the V lengths as the clustering is done based on the given germline length.\n\n\nWho are we?\nWe are part of the AIRR community and members of the IARC committee. Our target is to make immune repertoire exploration more accessible and fun! We want to create a space where we can discuss and explore the IGH reference and gain insights from the community."

    "text": "The term ‘Alleles groups’ defines alleles that have a degree of germline proximity. The proximity is defined as the hamming distance between the coding region of the alleles’ germline sequences. A distance matrix of all alleles’ hamming distance is constructed and the hierarchical tree is calculated. The tree leaves are then clustered by 95% similarity which creates the alleles groups.\nThis IGH reference book uses the current IMGT IGHV reference available. We selected functional alleles and trimmed the sequences up to position 318. We discarded alleles which are truncated in their 5’ region as well as those that are less then 318 nucleotides."

    "text": "Genotyping an Individual’s repertoire is becoming a common practice in down stream analysis. There are several tools nowadays to achieve such inference, namely TIgGER and IgDiscover. Though the methods are doing a fine job at inferring the genotype in high accuracy, they often neglect to detect lowly frequent alleles. The set of restriction the methods operates under enhance the specificity over the sensitivity.\nAside from low frequent alleles, another limitation that can hinder genotype inference is sequence multiple assignment. Each sequence in the repertoire is assigned its inferred V(D)J alleles for each of the segments. The assignments can be influenced by several factors, such as sequencing errors, somatic hyper mutations, amplicon length, and the initial reference set. This confounding factors can results in assigning more than a single allele per sequence segment. This multiple assignment has a downstream affect on the genotype inference. Each tool tries to deal with this effect in various ways.\nIn this reference book we observed the allele distribution across the population and derived threshold for determining genotype inference."
