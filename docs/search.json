    "text": "How to read this book?\nEach chapter of this book showcases a different IGHV ASC. The chapters include information on the expression of the alleles assigned to these ASCs in several projects. Our ASC-based genotype method has set allele thresholds and options to interactively “play” with the data, to gain insights into the ASC’s expressed alleles and the genotype combinations.\nWe included the allele groups for full and partial (BIOMED-2 (Van Dongen et al. 2003)) length V segments. The ASC numbers differ between the V lengths as the clustering is done based on the given germline length.\n\n\nWho are we?\nWe are part of the AIRR community and members of the IARC committee. Our target is to make immune repertoire exploration more accessible and fun! We want to create a space where we can discuss and explore the IGH reference and gain insights from the community.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCorcoran, Martin M., Ganesh E.

The proximity is defined as the Levenshtein distance between the coding region of the alleles’ germline sequences. A distance matrix of all alleles’ Levenshtein distance is constructed and the hierarchical tree is calculated. The tree leaves are then clustered by 95% similarity which creates the alleles clusters.\nThis IGH reference book uses the current IMGT IGHV reference available. We selected functional alleles and trimmed the sequences up to position 318. We discarded alleles which are truncated in their 5’ region as well as those that are less then 318 nucleotides."

    "text": "Genotyping an Individual’s repertoire is becoming a common practice in down stream analysis. There are several tools nowadays to achieve such inference, namely TIgGER(Gadala-Maria et al. 2015) and IgDiscover (Corcoran et al. 2016). Though the methods are doing a fine job at inferring the genotype in high accuracy, they often neglect to detect lowly frequent alleles. The set of restriction the methods operates under enhance the specificity over the sensitivity.\nAside from low frequent alleles, another limitation that can hinder genotype inference is sequence multiple assignment. Each sequence in the repertoire is assigned its inferred V(D)J alleles for each of the segments. The assignments can be influenced by several factors, such as sequencing errors, somatic hyper mutations, amplicon length, and the initial reference set. This confounding factors can results in assigning more than a single allele per sequence segment. This multiple assignment has a downstream affect on the genotype inference. Each tool tries to deal with this effect in various ways.\nIn this reference book we observed the allele distribution across the population and derived threshold for determining genotype inference."

Further by using the plot function on the returned object, a colorful visualization of the allele clusters dendrogram and threshold is received.\nThe function receives as an input a germline reference set of allele sequences, the filtration parameters for the 3’ and 5’ regions, and two similarity thresholds for the ASC clusters and families.\nTo create the clusters we will first load data from the package:\n\nThe IGHV germline reference - this reference set was download from IMGT in July 2022.\n\n\nlibrary(piglet)\ndata(HVGERM)\n\n2.The allele functionality table - the table contains functionality information for each of the alleles. Download from IMGT in July 2022\n\ndata(hv_functionality)\n\nBefore clustering the germline set, we will remove non functional alleles, alleles that do not start on the first 5’ nucleotide, and those that are shorter than 318 bases.\n\n\n\n\ncode listing 1: Clean germline set\ngermline <- HVGERM\n## keep only functional alleles\ngermline <- germline[hv_functionality$allele[hv_functionality$functional==\"F\"]]\n## keep only alleles that start from the first position of the V sequence\ngermline <- germline[!grepl(\"^[.]\", germline)]\n## keep only alleles that are at minimum 318 nucleotide long\ngermline <- germline[nchar(germline) >= 318]\n## keep only localized alleles (remove NL)\ngermline <- germline[!grepl(\"NL\", names(germline))]\n\nThen we will create the ASC clusters using the inferAlleleClusters function. For better clustering results with the human IGHV reference set, it is recommended to set the trim_3prime_side parameter to 318. Here, we will use the default similarity thresholds 75% for the family and 95% for the clusters.\n\n\n\n\ncode listing 2: ASC inference\nasc <- inferAlleleClusters(\n  germline_set = germline, \n  trim_3prime_side = 318, \n  mask_5prime_side = 0, \n  family_threshold = 75, \n  allele_cluster_threshold = 95)\n\nThe output of inferAlleleClusters is an S4 object of type GermlineCluster that contains several slots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlot\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngermlineSet\nThe input germline set with the 3’ and 5’ modifications (If defined)\n\n\nalleleClusterSet\nThe input germline set with the ASC name scheme, if exists without duplicated sequences\n\n\nalleleClusterTable\nThe allele similarity cluster with the new names and the default thresholds\n\n\nthreshold\nThe input family and allele cluster similarity thresholds\n\n\nhclustAlleleCluster\nGermline set hierarchical clustering, an hclust object\n\n\n\nWe can use the S4 plot method to plot the hierarchical clustering of the germline set as seen below in Figure 1.\n\nplot(asc)\n\n\n\n\nFig 1: The out most circle is the allele names, the second layer are the ASC groups, each group is labeled and colored.

Hence, a modified reference set for the sequenced region can help us further understand the results we can obtain from certain library protocols.\nHence, we created the function artificialFRW1Germline, to mimic the seen coding region of targeted framework 1 (FRW1) primers for a given reference set. The primers were obtained from BIOMED-2 protocol (Van Dongen et al. 2003).\nEssentially the function matches the primer to each of the germline set sequences and either mask or trim the region. The returned object is a character vector with the named sequence in the desire length (Trimmed/Masked).\nTo demonstrate the use of the function, we can use the cleaned germline set from above (Listing 1). In this case we will mask the FRW1 region, this will return the sequences with the Ns instead of DNA nucleotide. The function output a log of the process, this output can be repressed using the quite=TRUE flag.\n\ngermline_frw1 <- artificialFRW1Germline(germline, mask_primer = T)\n\n282/286 germline sequences have passed\nCounts by primers: \nVH1-FR1:53,VH2-FR1:25,VH3-FR1:122,VH4-FR1:69,VH5-FR1:10,VH6-FR1:3\n\n\nWe will look at one sequence, “IGHV1-8*01” to see the masking:\n\nallele = \"IGHV1-8*01\"\ndna_seq <- Biostrings::DNAStringSet(setNames(c(germline[allele], germline_frw1[allele]), \n                                             c(\"IGHS1V1-8*01\", \"IGHS2V1-8*01\")))\ncolors <- data.frame(names = c(\"A\",\"T\",\"C\",\"G\",\"N\",\".\"), \n                     color = c(\"#ff6d6d\",\"#769dcc\",\"#f2be3c\",\n                               \"#74ce98\",\"#b8b8b8\",\"#ffffff\"))\nggmsa::ggmsa(dna_seq, custom_color = colors, show.legend = T) + \n  ggmsa::facet_msa(field = 80)\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the artificial germline set to infer the ASC clusters in the same fashion as in Section 2.1"
