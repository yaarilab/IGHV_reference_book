<p>We set an initial cutoff of <span class="math inline">\(0.5\%\)</span> to determine the potential genotype priors. For this cutoff we examined the zygousity state, such as homozygousity, heterozygousity and so on.</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>With the selected cutoff we saw that there are 2 zygousity states.</p>
