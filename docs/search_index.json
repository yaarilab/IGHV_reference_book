[["index.html", "IGH Reference Book Preface", " IGH Reference Book Ayelet Peres, Gur Yaari pre { overflow-x: auto; } pre code { word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre; } This reference book is a collection of insights about the expressed IGHV genes in B cell repertoires, collected from several studies. The book showcases the dynamics between the known and novel alleles and offers a new way of inferring genotypes from expressed repertoires sequencing data. Preface Why reference book? With the newly gained information over the last two decades, it is time to re-evaluate how we infer and analyze genes and alleles in the expressed repertoire. IGHV alleles hold valuable information about the function of the adaptive immune system. This book uses IGH repertoires from VDJbase.org and describes a new way of exploring the expressed alleles and inferring genotypes. The book: Shows the expressed repertoire data of four projects from VDJbase.org. Includes interactive and dynamic visualizations. Integrated with applications that allow you to “play” with the data to gain new insights. Express yourself! Each page includes a comment section where you can add insights and thoughts about the expressed alleles and visualizations (under development). Genotyping is summarizing the genes and alleles an individual carries. Though capturing this information from genomic data is technically feasible, this is a very challenging task due to the highly repetitive nature of these genomic loci. In recent years several methods have been developed to deduce this information from expressed B cell receptor repertoires. These methods rely on a pre-set maximum number of alleles per gene that can appear in the genotype and the overall expression of the alleles. Although the current methods have their merits, they do possess several cavities that can bias the inferred genotypes. One major pitfall is the goodness of the alignment. Each aligned sequence is assigned with one or more matching allele annotations. Several factors can cause errors in the final annotations for each given sequence, the major ones are somatic hypermutations, the length of the sequenced V(D)J segments, and the quality of the sequencing. The existing genotype inference methods attempt to overcome these factors but are not very successful. In this book, we raise the idea of abandoning the concept of genes for inferring a genotype and rather determining the alleles directly. To better understand the influence of the alleles on one another, the alleles were divided into functional groups. These groups were clustered based on the nucleotide level similarity between the allele’s germline sequence (For more information see chapter 1). This concept of allele clustering is not new and was previously performed by IMGT. Yet, with gained information from the last two decades on the expressed alleles, we sought to re-group the alleles. This re-grouping into the functional groups is consistent with the observed multiple annotations in sequences within the expressed repertoires. How to read this book? Each chapter of this book showcases a different IGHV functional group. The chapters include information on the expression of the alleles assigned to these groups in several projects. Our allele-based genotype method has set allele thresholds and options to interactively “play” with the data, to gain insights into the group’s expressed alleles and the genotype combinations. We included the functional groups for full and partial (BIOMED-2) length V segments. The groups’ numbers differ between the V lengths as the clustering is done based on the given germline length. Who are we? We are part of the AIRR community and members of the IARC committee. Our target is to make immune repertoire exploration more accessible and fun! We want to create a space where we can discuss and explore the IGH reference and gain insights from the community. "],["01-Datasets.html", "Introduction Datasets and processing Alleles functional group", " Introduction Datasets and processing Summary statistics for each of the functional groups declared in the app. The book includes these datasets taken from VDJbase.org: dataset Type Sequence Length P1 Naive Full length P11 Naive Full length The repertoires have been processed as following: Functional sequence, no stop codons or frame shifts. Sequences which start from position 1 of the V gene for full length sequences. Sequences which didn’t include any gaps (-) or any N’s in the V region. After changing into group annotations, sequences which had more than a single assignment in naive repertoires were remove. Alleles functional group The term ‘Alleles groups’ defines alleles that have a degree of germline proximity. The proximity is defined as the hamming distance between the coding region of the alleles’ germline sequences. A distance matrix of all alleles’ hamming distance is constructed and the hierarchical tree is calculated. The tree leaves are then clustered by 95% similarity which creates the alleles groups. For this IGH reference book we have used the current IMGT IGHV reference available. We selected functional alleles and trimmed the sequences up to position 318. We discarded alleles which are truncated in their 5’ region as well as those that are less then 318 nucleotides. The book will also defines the group for partial V sequence, those are are the cause of different library amplicon protocols. We will adapte the alleles group to three protocols: Library amplicon length Coverage Similar known protocl S1 Full length 5’ Race S2 Starting within the framework 1 BIOMED-2 S3 End of the V region Adaptive An illustration of the sequences length can be seen below: The figure bellow shows the relation between the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) and IMGT named alleles and the clustered alleles’ groups. Figure 1: Hierarchical clustering of the functional IGH germline set. The inner layer shows a dendrogram of the clustering, the dotted circles indicates the sequence similarity of 75% (orange) and 95% (blue). The dendrogram branches are colored by the 75% sequence similarity. The second, colored circle shows the groups and alleles for the library amplicon length of S1, the second circle for length of S2, and the third for S3. The white color indicates alleles that cannot be distinguished in the library’s germline set.
