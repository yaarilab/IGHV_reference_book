	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of B-cell immunoglobulin receptors is providing unprecedented insight into adaptive immunity. A key step in analyzing these data involves assignment of the germline variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene-segment alleles that comprise each immunoglobulin sequence by matching them against a database of known V(D)J alleles. However, this process will fail for sequences that use previously undetected alleles, whose frequency in the population is unclear. Here we describe TIgGER, a computational method that significantly improves V(D)J allele assignments by first determining the complete set of gene segments carried by a subject, including novel alleles. The application of TIgGER identifies a surprisingly high frequency of novel alleles, highlighting the critical need for this approach.Individual variation in germline and expressed B-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoires has been associated with aging, disease susceptibility, and differential response to infection and vaccination. Repertoire properties can now be studied at large-scale through next-generation sequencing of rearranged Ig genes. Accurate analysis of these repertoire-sequencing (Rep-Seq) data requires identifying the germline variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments used by each Ig sequence. Current V(D)J assignment methods work by aligning sequences to a database of known germline V(D)J segment alleles. However, existing databases are likely to be incomplete and novel polymorphisms are hard to differentiate from the frequent occurrence of somatic hypermutations in Ig sequences. Here we develop a Tool for Ig Genotype Elucidation via Rep-Seq (TIgGER). TIgGER analyzes mutation patterns in Rep-Seq data to identify novel V segment alleles, and also constructs a personalized germline database containing the specific set of alleles carried by a subject. This information is then used to improve the initial V segment assignments from existing tools, like IMGT/HighV-QUEST. The application of TIgGER to Rep-Seq data from seven subjects identified 11 novel V segment alleles, including at least one in every subject examined. These novel alleles constituted 13\% of the total number of unique alleles in these subjects, and impacted 3\% of V(D)J segment assignments. These results reinforce the highly polymorphic nature of human Ig V genes, and suggest that many novel alleles remain to be discovered. The integration of TIgGER into Rep-Seq processing pipelines will increase the accuracy of V segment assignments, thus improving B-cell repertoire analyses.},

ABSTRACT={The adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) contains information on an individuals' immune past, present and potential in the form of the evolving sequences that encode the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. AIRR sequencing (AIRR-seq) studies rely on databases of known BCR germline variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes to detect somatic mutations in AIRR-seq data via comparison to the best-aligning database alleles. However, it has been shown that these databases are far from complete, leading to systematic misidentification of mutated positions in subsets of sample sequences. We previously presented TIgGER, a computational method to identify subject-specific V gene genotypes, including the presence of novel V gene alleles, directly from AIRR-seq data. However, the original algorithm was unable to detect alleles that differed by more than 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a database allele. Here we present and apply an improved version of the TIgGER algorithm which can detect alleles that differ by any number of SNPs from the nearest database allele, and can construct subject-specific genotypes with minimal prior information. TIgGER predictions are validated both computationally (using a leave-one-out strategy) and experimentally (using genomic sequencing), resulting in the addition of three new immunoglobulin heavy chain V (IGHV) gene alleles to the IMGT repertoire. Finally, we develop a Bayesian strategy to provide a confidence estimate associated with genotype calls. All together, these methods allow for much higher accuracy in germline allele assignment, an essential step in AIRR-seq studies.}

ABSTRACT={High-throughput sequencing has the power to reveal the nature of adaptive immunity as represented by the full complexity of T cell receptor (TCR) and antibody (IG) repertoires, but is at present severely compromised by the quantitative bias, bottlenecks, and accumulated errors that inevitably occur in the course of library preparation and sequencing. Here we report an optimized protocol for the unbiased preparation of TCR and IG cDNA libraries for high-throughput sequencing, starting from thousands or millions of live cells in an investigated sample. Critical points to control are revealed, along with tips that allow researchers to minimize quantitative bias, accumulated errors, and cross-sample contamination at each stage, and to enhance the subsequent bioinformatic analysis.  The protocol is simple, reliable, and can be performed in 1–2 days.}

Generated through a process of gene duplication/deletion and diversification, these loci can vary extensively between individuals in copy number and contain genes that are highly similar, making their analysis technically challenging. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the functional gene segments in the IGHV and TRBV loci, quantifying their copy number and single-nucleotide variation in a globally diverse sample of 109 (IGHV) and 286 (TRBV) humans from over a 100 populations. We find that the IGHV and TRBV gene families exhibit starkly different patterns of variation. In addition to providing insight into the different evolutionary paths of the IGHV and TRBV loci, our results are also important to the adaptive immune repertoire sequencing community, where the lack of frequencies of common alleles and copy number variants is hampering existing analytical pipelines.},

ABSTRACT={Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health concern, with over 70 million people infected worldwide, who are at risk for developing life-threatening liver disease. No vaccine is available, and immunity against the virus is not well-understood. Following the acute stage, HCV usually causes chronic infections. However, ~30\% of infected individuals spontaneously clear the virus. Therefore, using HCV as a model for comparing immune responses between spontaneous clearer (SC) and chronically infected (CI) individuals may empower the identification of mechanisms governing viral infection outcomes. Here, we provide the first in-depth analysis of adaptive immune receptor repertoires in individuals with current or past HCV infection. We demonstrate that SC individuals, in contrast to CI patients, develop clusters of antibodies with distinct properties. These antibodies' characteristics were used in a machine learning framework to accurately predict infection outcome. Using combinatorial antibody phage display library technology, we identified HCV-specific antibody sequences. By integrating these data with the repertoire analysis, we constructed two antibodies characterized by high neutralization breadth, which are associated with clearance. This study provides insight into the nature of effective immune response against HCV and demonstrates an innovative approach for constructing antibodies correlating with successful infection clearance. It may have clinical implications for prognosis of the future status of infection, and the design of effective immunotherapies and a vaccine for HCV.}

	abstract = {The existence of many highly similar genes in the lymphocyte receptor gene loci makes them difficult to investigate, and the determination of phased {\textquotedblleft}haplotypes{\textquotedblright} has been particularly problematic. However, V(D)J gene rearrangements provide an opportunity to infer the association of Ig genes along the chromosomes. The chromosomal distribution of H chain genes in an Ig genotype can be inferred through analysis of VDJ rearrangements in individuals who are heterozygous at points within the IGH locus. We analyzed VDJ rearrangements from 44 individuals for whom sufficient unique rearrangements were available to allow comprehensive genotyping. Nine individuals were identified who were heterozygous at the IGHJ6 locus and for whom sufficient suitable VDJ rearrangements were available to allow comprehensive haplotyping. Each of the 18 resulting IGHV|IGHD|IGHJ haplotypes was unique. Apparent deletion polymorphisms were seen that involved as many as four contiguous, functional IGHV genes. Two deletion polymorphisms involving multiple contiguous IGHD genes were also inferred. Three previously unidentified gene duplications were detected, where two sequences recognized as allelic variants of a single gene were both inferred to be on a single chromosome. Phased genomic data brings clarity to the study of the contribution of each gene to the available repertoire of rearranged VDJ genes. Analysis of rearrangement frequencies suggests that particular genes may have substantially different yet predictable propensities for rearrangement within different haplotypes. Together with data highlighting the extent of haplotypic variation within the population, this suggests that there may be substantial variability in the available Ab repertoires of different individuals.},

abstract={Choosing appropriate primers is probably the single most important factor affecting the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific amplification of the intended target requires that primers do not have matches to other targets in certain orientations and within certain distances that allow undesired amplification. The process of designing specific primers typically involves two stages. First, the primers flanking regions of interest are generated either manually or using software tools; then they are searched against an appropriate nucleotide sequence database using tools such as BLAST to examine the potential targets. However, the latter is not an easy process as one needs to examine many details between primers and targets, such as the number and the positions of matched bases, the primer orientations and distance between forward and reverse primers. The complexity of such analysis usually makes this a time-consuming and very difficult task for users, especially when the primers have a large number of hits. Furthermore, although the BLAST program has been widely used for primer target detection, it is in fact not an ideal tool for this purpose as BLAST is a local alignment algorithm and does not necessarily return complete match information over the entire primer range.},

This technology has been used in the study of the B-cell and T-cell receptor repertoire. The novelty of immunosequencing comes from the recent rapid development of techniques and the exponential reduction in cost of sequencing. Here, we describe some of the technologies, which we collectively refer to as Rep-Seq (repertoire sequencing), to portray achievements in the field and to present the essential and inseparable role of next-generation sequencing to the understanding of entities in immune response. The large Rep-Seq data sets that should be available in the near future call for new computational algorithms to segue the transition from ‘classic’ molecular-based analysis to system-wide analysis. The combination of new algorithms with high-throughput data will form the basis for possible new clinical implications in personalized medicine and deeper understanding of immune behaviour and immune response.},

In this review, we discussed the processes of TCR revision in peripheral immune environment, the changes in TCR repertoire that occurred in various AIDs, and the specifically expanded T cell clones. We hope our discussion can provide insights for the future studies, helping with the discovery of disease biomarkers and expanding the strategies of immune-targeted therapy."

By applying next-generation sequencing of replicate TCRB libraries from highly purified T-cell subsets, and using nonparametric statistical analysis, we obtain estimates of repertoire richness in the young adult that are higher than previously reported. Although contracting with age, the repertoire remains highly diverse. These data challenge the paradigm that thymic rejuvenation is needed to maintain diversity and prevent immune incompetence in the elderly. However, we observe an increasing inequality of clonal sizes with age even among na{\"\i}ve T cells. This clonal selection could result in biased and possibly autoreactive immune responses.T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity, a prerequisite for immune system recognition of the universe of foreign antigens, is generated in the first two decades of life in the thymus and then persists to an unknown extent through life via homeostatic proliferation of na{\"\i}ve T cells. We have used next-generation sequencing and nonparametric statistical analysis to estimate a lower bound for the total number of different TCR beta (TCRB) sequences in human repertoires. We arrived at surprisingly high minimal estimates of 100 million unique TCRB sequences in na{\"\i}ve CD4 and CD8 T-cell repertoires of young adults. Na{\"\i}ve repertoire richness modestly declined two- to fivefold in healthy elderly. Repertoire richness contraction with age was even less pronounced for memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. In contrast, age had a major impact on the inequality of clonal sizes, as estimated by a modified Gini{\textendash}Simpson index clonality score. In particular, large na{\"\i}ve T-cell clones that were distinct from memory clones were found in the repertoires of elderly individuals, indicating uneven homeostatic proliferation without development of a memory cell phenotype. Our results suggest that a highly diverse repertoire is maintained despite thymic involution; however, peripheral fitness selection of T cells leads to repertoire perturbations that can influence the immune response in the elderly.},

abstract={In a European BIOMED-2 collaborative study, multiplex PCR assays have successfully been developed and standardized for the detection of clonally rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes and the chromosome aberrations t(11;14) and t(14;18). This has resulted in 107 different primers in only 18 multiplex PCR tubes: three VH--JH, two DH--JH, two Ig kappa (IGK), one Ig lambda (IGL), three TCR beta (TCRB), two TCR gamma (TCRG), one TCR delta (TCRD), three BCL1-Ig heavy chain (IGH), and one BCL2-IGH. The PCR products of Ig/TCR genes can be analyzed for clonality assessment by heteroduplex analysis or GeneScanning. The detection rate of clonal rearrangements using the BIOMED-2 primer sets is unprecedentedly high. This is mainly based on the complementarity of the various BIOMED-2 tubes. In particular, combined application of IGH (VH--JH and DH--JH) and IGK tubes can detect virtually all clonal B-cell proliferations, even in B-cell malignancies with high levels of somatic mutations. The contribution of IGL gene rearrangements seems limited. Combined usage of the TCRB and TCRG tubes detects virtually all clonal T-cell populations, whereas the TCRD tube has added value in case of TCR$\gamma\delta$ T-cell proliferations. The BIOMED-2 multiplex tubes can now be used for diagnostic clonality studies as well as for the identification of PCR targets suitable for the detection of minimal residual disease.},

abstract={The adaptive immune system uses several strategies to generate a repertoire of T- and B-cell antigen receptors with sufficient diversity to recognize the universe of potential pathogens. In alphabeta T cells, which primarily recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules, most of this receptor diversity is contained within the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains. Although it has been estimated that the adaptive immune system can generate up to 10(16) distinct alphabeta pairs, direct assessment of TCR CDR3 diversity has not proved amenable to standard capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencing. We developed a novel experimental and computational approach to measure TCR CDR3 diversity based on single-molecule DNA sequencing, and used this approach to determine the CDR3 sequence in millions of rearranged TCRbeta genes from T cells of 2 adults. We find that total TCRbeta receptor diversity is at least 4-fold higher than previous estimates, and the diversity in the subset of CD45RO(+) antigen-experienced alphabeta T cells is at least 10-fold higher than previous estimates. These methods should prove valuable for assessment of alphabeta T-cell repertoire diversity after hematopoietic cell transplantation, in states of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, and during normal aging.},

abstract={Bacterial diversity among environmental samples is commonly assessed with PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene (16S) sequences. Perceived diversity, however, can be influenced by sample preparation, primer selection, and formation of chimeric 16S amplification products. Chimeras are hybrid products between multiple parent sequences that can be falsely interpreted as novel organisms, thus inflating apparent diversity. We developed a new chimera detection tool called Chimera Slayer (CS). CS detects chimeras with greater sensitivity than previous methods, performs well on short sequences such as those produced by the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer, and can scale to large data sets. By benchmarking CS performance against sequences derived from a controlled DNA mixture of known organisms and a simulated chimera set, we provide insights into the factors that affect chimera formation such as sequence abundance, the extent of similarity between 16S genes, and PCR conditions. Chimeras were found to reproducibly form among independent amplifications and contributed to false perceptions of sample diversity and the false identification of novel taxa, with less-abundant species exhibiting chimera rates exceeding 70{\%}. Shotgun metagenomic sequences of our mock community appear to be devoid of 16S chimeras, supporting a role for shotgun metagenomics in validating novel organisms discovered in targeted sequence surveys.},

Previous efforts to evaluate TRBV polymorphism by whole genome sequencing have been hampered by the repetitive nature of the T-cell receptor beta (TCRB) locus. We present a novel long-amplicon TCRB repertoire sequencing approach to enable TRBV haplotype analysis from peripheral blood. Methods: Peripheral blood leukocyte total RNA from 81 Caucasians was used for sequencing of TCRB chains via the Oncomine TCRB-LR assay (amplicon spanning CDR1, 2 and 3) and the Ion Gene Studio S5. VDJ rearrangements were annotated by comparison to the IMGT database, then mined to construct TRBV allele profiles for each individual including, where detected, novel alleles not present in the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database. Finally, TRBV allele profiles were subjected to principal component analysis and k-means clustering to identify TRBV allele haplotypes. Results: Clustering analysis revealed the presence of six major sets of coincident TRBV alleles, which we term haplotype groups. Allelic diversity varied markedly across haplotype groups, with approximately one third of the cohort showing limited TRBV allelic diversity and few uncommon alleles compared to members of other groups. Analysis revealed 37 putatively novel TRBV alleles that are absent from the IMGT database. Conclusion: We demonstrate a straightforward and cost-efficient method for TRBV haplotype analysis from long-amplicon TCRB sequencing data.}",

Although genetic variability is known to greatly impact on the human immune system and the outcome of infection, the influence of sequence variation leading to the inactivation or deletion of TCR gene segments is unknown. To investigate this issue, we examined the CD8+ T cell response to an HLA-B7{\textendash}restricted epitope (265RPHERNGFTVL275) from the pp65 Ag of human CMV that was highly biased and frequently dominated by a public TCR$\beta$-chain encoded by the variable gene segment TRBV4-3. Approximately 40\% of humans lack T cells expressing TRBV4-3 because of a 21.5-kb insertion/deletion polymorphism, but these individuals remain responsive to this epitope, using a diverse T cell repertoire characterized by private TCR usage. Although most residues within the bulged 11-mer peptide were accessible for TCR contact, the public and private TCRs showed distinct patterns of sensitivity to amino acid substitution at different positions within the peptide, thereby suggesting that the repertoire diversity generated in the absence of the dominant public TRBV4-3+ TCR could lead to better protection from viral escape mutation. Thus, variation in the size of the TRBV repertoire clearly contributes toward interindividual variability in immune responses and is presumably maintained in many ethnic groups to enhance the diversity of Ag-specific T cell responses.},

Two TCRBV gene segments were present only in inserted haplotypes; one of these, TCRBV7S3, is a functional gene and the other, TCRBV9S2(P), is a pseudogene because of an inframe termination colon. In addition, inserted haplotypes contain two identical copies of the TCRBV13S2 gene, whereas deleted haplotypes have only one copy. Deleted haplotypes could be subdivided into two types, deleted*1 and deleted*2, on the basis of sequence variations in TCRBV6S7 and TCRBV13S2 genes. Both deleted*1 and deleted*2 haplotypes contained the same number of TCRBV genes; both contain 60 genes of which 50 are functional, whereas, inserted haplotypes contained 63 genes of which 52 are functional. Comparisons of inserted region sequences with the homologous region in a deleted haplotype, and with sequences surrounding related TCRBV genes, revealed patterns of similarity that suggest insertion as well as deletion events have occurred in the evolution of the TCRBV gene complex. These data indicate that the genomic TCR repertoire is expanded in individuals who have inserted TCRBV haplotypes. The presence of additional TCRBV genes or, alternatively, the absence of certain TCRBV genes may have an impact upon immune responses and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.}",

	abstract = {Variation in the antibody response has been linked to differential outcomes in disease, and suboptimal vaccine and therapeutic responsiveness, the determinants of which have not been fully elucidated. Countering models that presume antibodies are generated largely by stochastic processes, we demonstrate that polymorphisms within the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) significantly impact the naive and antigen-experienced antibody repertoire, indicating that genetics predisposes individuals to mount qualitatively and quantitatively different antibody responses. We pair recently developed long-read genomic sequencing methods with antibody repertoire profiling to comprehensively resolve IGH genetic variation, including novel structural variants, single nucleotide variants, and genes and alleles. We show that IGH germline variants determine the presence and frequency of antibody genes in the expressed repertoire, including those enriched in functional elements linked to V(D)J recombination, and overlapping disease-associated variants. These results illuminate the power of leveraging IGH genetics to better understand the regulation, function and dynamics of the antibody response in disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, the knowledge of the genomic variation of the immunoglobulin loci is scarce. Here, we report 25 potential novel germline IGHV alleles as inferred from rearranged naïve B cell cDNA repertoires of 98 individuals. Thirteen novel alleles were selected for validation, out of which ten were successfully confirmed by targeted amplification and Sanger sequencing of non-B cell DNA. Moreover, we detected a high degree of variability upstream of the V-REGION in the 5′UTR, L-PART1 and L-PART2 sequences, and found that identical V-REGION alleles can differ in upstream sequences. Thus, we have identified a large genetic variation not only in the V-REGION but also in the upstream sequences of IGHV genes. Our findings provide a new perspective for annotating immunoglobulin repertoire sequencing data.}",

abstract={COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has recently affected over 1,200,000people and killed more than 60,000. The key immune cell subsets change and theirstates during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear. We sought to comprehensivelycharacterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cellsduring the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique. Itwas found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patientsin the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19. There was an increased ratio ofclassical CD14++ monocytes with high inflammatory geneexpression as well as a greater abundance ofCD14++IL1$\beta$+ monocytes inthe ERS. CD4+ T cells and CD8+T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes inthe ERS. Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the na{\"i}veB cells decreased. Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, suchas IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previouslyused for virus vaccine development were confirmed. The strongest pairingfrequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2specificity, which had not been reported yet. Furthermore, integrated analysispredicted that IL-1$\beta$ and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatorystorm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery ofCOVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immunesignature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable afterhospital discharge. Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to thedevelopment of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.},

abstract = "The aim of the study was to assess the influence of constraints of V-D-J rearrangement on the nonrandom junctional diversity of productive T-cell receptor β-chain genes in peripheral T-cells. Mature peripheral T lymphocytes are expected to display a biased repertoire of T cell receptors (TCRs), enriched for those that can recognize peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Therefore, functional TCR rearrangements of peripheral T-cells are unsuitable to reveal the bias of the TCR repertoire, introduced by V-D-J rearrangement. To overcome this problem, we have studied nonfunctional TCR genes representing a repertoire of rearranged TCR gene sequences without any known post-rearrangement selection. Detailed molecular analysis of a database generated from more than 500 functional (TCRBV20S1) and nonfunctional (TCRBV10S1P and TCRBV19S1P) T-cell receptor genes from peripheral blood T-cells permitted a comparative analysis of recombination frequencies of each germline-encoded V, D, and J-segments, as well as exonucleolytic nibbling and addition of nucleotides in functional and nonfunctional transcripts. Our data demonstrate that V-D-J recombination generates a more diverse CDR3 length distribution than found among productive TCRBV genes, suggesting that selection constrains the CDR3 to an optimal junctional region length. Furthermore, the well established biased patterns of D- and J-usage in the rearranged TCRBV genes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes were also present in nonfunctional transcripts. Therefore, V-D-J diversity is biased mainly by constraints of the rearrangement process rather than intrathymic T-cell selection and peripheral expansion of particular T-cell clones."

	abstract = {At the population level, immunoglobulin (IG) loci harbor inter-individual allelic variants in the many different germline IG variable (V), Diversity (D) and Joining (J) genes of the IG heavy (IGH), IG kappa (IGK) and IG lambda (IGL) loci, which together form the genetic basis of the highly diverse antigen-specific B-cell receptors. These inter-individual allelic variants can be shared between or be specific to human populations. The current IG databases IMGT, VBASE2 and IgPdb hold information about germline alleles, most of which are partial sequences, obtained from a mixture of human (B-cell) samples, many with sequence errors and/or acquired (non-germline) IG variations, induced by somatic hypermutation (SHM) during antigen-specific B-cell responses. We systematically identified true germline alleles (without SHM) from 26 different human populations around the world, profiled by the {\textquotedblleft}1000 Genomes data{\textquotedblright}. Our resource is uniquely enriched with complete IG allele sequences and their frequencies across human populations. We identified 409 IGHV, 179 IGKV, and 199 IGLV germline alleles supported by at least seven haplotypes (= minimum of four individuals), after removal of potential false-positives, based on using other genomic databases, i.e. ENSEMBL, TopMed, ExAC, ProjectMine. Remarkably, the positions of the identified variant nucleotides of the different alleles are not at random (as observed in case of SHM), but show striking patterns, restricted to limited nucleotide positions, the same as found in other IG data bases, suggesting over-time evolutionary selection processes. The identification of these specific patterns provides extra evidence that the identified variant nucleotides are not sequencing errors, but genuine allelic variants. The diversity of germline allelic variants in IGH and IGL loci is the highest in Africans, while the IGK locus is most diverse in Europeans. We also report on the presence of recombination signal sequences (RSS) in V pseudogenes, explaining their usage in V(D)J rearrangements. We propose that this new set of genuine germline IG sequences can serve as a new population-matched IG (pmIG) database for better understanding B-cell repertoire and B-cell receptor selection processes in disease and vaccination within and between different human populations. The database in format of fasta is available via GitHub (https://github.com/InduKhatri/pmIG).Contribution to the Field Statement We present a catalogue of immunoglobulin (IG) germline-alleles of unprecedented completeness and accuracy from 26 different human populations belonging to five different large ethnicities (Source: 1000 Genomes). We identified the population distribution of several known germline alleles and identified multiple new alleles, especially in African populations, indicative of high allelic diversity of IG genes in Africa. Strikingly, the identified variant nucleotides of the different alleles are not at random, but show striking patterns, restricted to limited nucleotide positions, the same as found in other IG databases, suggesting over-time evolutionary selection processes. Furthermore, we identified recombination signal sequences in pseudogenes (previously not known). We provide an overview of IG germline alleles shared with and between known databases and also point to potential sources of non-germline variation and incompleteness of the existing IG databases. More importantly, we believe that this information can serve as a novel population-matched IG (pmIG) database, highly valuable for the research community in supporting the dissection and understanding of differences in effectiveness of antibody-based immune responses in infectious diseases, other (immune) diseases and vaccination within and between human populations. Such knowledge might be used in developing population-specific vaccination strategies e.g. for currently ongoing SARS-CoV2 pandemic.Competing Interest StatementJ. J.

ABSTRACT={Analyses of somatic hypermutation (SHM) patterns in B cell immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences contribute to our basic understanding of adaptive immunity, and have broad applications not only for understanding the immune response to pathogens, but also to determining the role of SHM in autoimmunity and B cell cancers. Although stochastic, SHM displays intrinsic biases that can confound statistical analysis, especially when combined with the particular codon usage and base composition in Ig sequences. Analysis of B cell clonal expansion, diversification, and selection processes thus critically depends on an accurate background model for SHM micro-sequence targeting (i.e., hot/cold-spots) and nucleotide substitution. Existing models are based on small numbers of sequences/mutations, in part because they depend on data from non-coding regions or non-functional sequences to remove the confounding influences of selection. Here, we combine high-throughput Ig sequencing with new computational analysis methods to produce improved models of SHM targeting and substitution that are based only on synonymous mutations, and are thus independent of selection. The resulting “S5F” models are based on 806,860 Synonymous mutations in 5-mer motifs from 1,145,182 Functional sequences and account for dependencies on the adjacent four nucleotides (two bases upstream and downstream of the mutation). The estimated profiles can explain almost half of the variance in observed mutation patterns, and clearly show that both mutation targeting and substitution are significantly influenced by neighboring bases. While mutability and substitution profiles were highly conserved across individuals, the variability across motifs was found to be much larger than previously estimated. The model and method source code are made available at http://clip.med.yale.edu/SHM}

GRCh38 is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since 2009 and reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and encompasses modifications ranging from thousands of single base changes to megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures and localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and used data from new genome mapping technologies and single haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also expanded the number of alternate loci to create a reference that provides a more robust representation of human population variation. We demonstrate that the updates render the reference an improved annotation substrate, alter read alignments in unchanged regions and impact variant interpretation at clinically relevant loci. We additionally evaluated a collection of new de novo long-read haploid assemblies and conclude that while the new assemblies compare favorably to the reference with respect to continuity, error rate, and gene completeness, the reference still provides the best representation for complex genomic regions and coding sequences. We assert that the collected updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust substrate for comprehensive analyses that will promote our understanding of human biology and advance our efforts to improve health.},
